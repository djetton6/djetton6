#### 🏉 🍩 💻 About Me:

My developer journey began as a City Year Corps Member in LA, where a student’s question, “Why do I need Algebra?” inspired me to dive into coding. I told them, “So you can learn how to code,” and from that moment, I was hooked. After self-teaching and volunteering at Teens Exploring Technology, I joined Illinois Tech’s Global Leaders Program to further my passion for education and tech.

With 5+ years of experience as a Software Engineer, I specialize in React, Next.js, and TypeScript, and have delivered solutions in Python, Java, and React Native. My interests include Web Performance and Product Engineering, especially green field projects.

My super power is asking not being afraid or ashamed to ask questions, leading to my team feeling confident that we've found the correct solution.

#### 🚀 Words I Live By: “Will code for donuts” — but after working with great developers, “First principles development always wins.”
